# Cops-and-Robbers
The contents of the repository included are things that I Ethan Senor have solely created. The addtional files provided by the
professor are still awaiting permission to post. The point class deals with fractional arithmetic. The fractions are made with the 
files that the professor provided and will be up shortly. The points entered are then used to make the largest possible geometric shape
then the points entered for people are calculated to be inside either the cops or the robbers convex hull and the outputs for the 
results are then outputed to the user.
